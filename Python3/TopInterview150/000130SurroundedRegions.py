# You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

# Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
# Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
# Surround: A region is surrounded if none of the 'O' cells in that region are on the edge of the board. Such regions are completely enclosed by 'X' cells.
# To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

# Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

# Explanation:


# In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

# Example 2:

# Input: board = [["X"]]

# Output: [["X"]]

 

# Constraints:

# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 200
# board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
